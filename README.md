The password is created using the following rules:
• The letters ‘a’, ’e’, and ‘t’ from the given full name will not be used in the password
• Each vowel (except ‘a’ and ‘e’ which are eliminated) is going to be added twice
• Each space is replaced by the letter ‘S’ followed by a ‘&’ and a ‘?’
• All the other characters will remain the same as in the given full name
• The password ends with the total number of letters eliminated (i.e. the total number of letters ‘a’, ’e’, and ‘t’ from the given full name that were not used in the password)
